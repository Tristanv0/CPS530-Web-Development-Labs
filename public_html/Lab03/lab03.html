                    When working on part A of the lab, some problems I encountered was understanding how the columns worked,
                    how to use them, and constantly having to pay attention to very small detail. A lot of testing was required
                    as I had to check my website everytime a css style was added to ensure it looked the way I wanted it to look.
                    On the other hand, in Part B, using bootstrap for the first time was challenging to wrap my head around all
                    the different elements or customizable options provided. It required an extensive amount of
                    time looking through documentation and examples to get my desired outcome. However, bootstrap made it 
                    significantly easier to construct my website and generally took less time even though I had to constantly refer to 
                    bootstrap's documentation.

        <div class="col-sm-5">
            <a href="lab03b.html" class="btn btn-primary">Part B</a>
            <div class="paragraph-box2">
                <span>
                    In terms of efficiency, utilizing bootstrap components made constructing a website quicker.
                    I was able to use the pre-built containers for my texts rather than having to maunally make
                    all functions for every container like in Part A. Although I had more control over customization with Part A,
                    the complexity made it much more time-consuming. Personally, I found Part B more enjoyable as I was 
                    able to balance creativity with efficiency.
